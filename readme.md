# Telegram Bot-Creator Bot
Bachelor's thesis project, Jan. 2018, Shahid Beheshti University.
[video demo of the main features](https://youtu.be/o6BioCvDh9k) (the bot was created for Persian users and the bots function in Farsi)
Telegram is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, and bots are one of its popular features. The goal of this project was to create a platform where ordinary people with no knowledge of programming can create and customize their bot.

We have one central bot that guides the creators into getting a bot token from Telegram BotFather. Then, they would give the token they received to the central bot. Next, they can choose between creating a "General" or "Retail" bot. 

General bot's main features:
* menu creation/deletion
* adding pictures, videos, etc in each menu
* sending a message to subscribers 
* Instagram integration (connecting bot to Instagram so that the subscribers would be notified about a new Instagram post).

Retail bot's main features:
* creating/removing product categories
* adding/removing products to each category (picture, price, description)
* adding branch list
* adding about us section
* sending a message to subscribers 
* Instagram integration



### This repository is not maintained
* Updates of Telegram and Instagram API since Jan. 2018 are not integrated into this project.
* **The project was developed at a time when Instagram API for the developers was not too restrictive. Therefore, you may not be able to use the Instagram integration part.**

### The bot is not active anymore
